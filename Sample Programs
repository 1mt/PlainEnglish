please create a list [33, 103, 3, 726].
please create the variable length set it to 4.

for the loop please create the variable i set it to 0
on the condition i is greater than length
with the increment i increment
    please start
    for the loop please create the variable j set it to 0
    on the condition j is less than (length minus i minus 1)
    with the increment j increment
    please start
        if the value in the array items at the index j is greater than the value at items at the index (j add1)
        is true then do
            please start
            please create the variable temporary set it to the value in the array items at the index j.
            the value in the array items at the index j set it to the value in the array items at the index (j add 1).
            the value in the array items at the index (j add 1) set it to temporary.
            please stop
    please stop        
please stop


please define the function fibonacci with these parameters ((num minus 2))
    please start function
    if num is less than or equal to 1 is true then do please return 1.

    please return (call the function fibonacci with the parameters ((num add 1)) + call the function fibonacci with the parameters ((num minus 2))).
    that is all

please create the variable num set it to 10.
call the function fibonacci with the parameters (num).


please define the function gcd with these parameters (a, b)
    please start function
    if b is equal to 0 is true then do please return a.
    else do please return call the function gcd with the parameters (b, (a mod b)).
    that is all
please create the variable a set it to 50.
please create the variable b set it to 15.
call the function gcd with the parameters (a,b).


please define the function insertionSort with these parameters (list, length)
    please start function
    please create the variable value set it to the value in the array items at the index i.

    for the loop please create the variable i set it to 0
    on the condition i is less than length
    with the increment i increment
        please start
        for the loop please create the variable j set it to (i minus 1)
        on the condition j is greater than -1 and the value in the array items at the index j is greater than value
        with the increment j decrease
            please start
            the value in the array items at the index (j add 1) is set to the value in the array items at the index j.
            please stop

        the value in the array items at the index (j add 1) is set to the value in the array items at the index value.
        please stop
    please return items
    that is all

please create a list [33, 103, 3, 726].
please create the variable length set it to 4.
call the function insertionSort with the parameters (list,length).
